# Concert Tickets

I had a concert event that I had to give tickets to the guests and let them know where they need to sit. <br />  
So I decided to write this code that create to every single guest a folder with his tickets.  <br />
This folder include all his tickets with the seating places and all the information he need to the concert.  <br />
The tickets are in PDFs format.  <br />
With this code you can create tickets to any event you have.
I hope you will enjoy and find this code useful and clear.
